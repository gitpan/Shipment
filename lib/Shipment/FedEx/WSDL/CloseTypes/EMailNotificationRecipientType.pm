Shipment::FedEx::WSDL::CloseTypes::EMailNotificationRecipientType

=head1 VERSION

version 0.12

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined simpleType
EMailNotificationRecipientType from the namespace http://fedex.com/ws/close/v2.

Identifies the set of valid email notification recipient types. For SHIPPER, RECIPIENT and BROKER the email address asssociated with their definitions will be used, any email address sent with the email notification for these three email notification recipient types will be ignored.

This clase is derived from 
   SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string
. SOAP::WSDL's schema implementation does not validate data, so you can use it exactly
like it's base type.
